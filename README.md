miscstats
===============================

> Python package to reimplement statistical functions in R's
> [`stats` package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html).


Overview
--------

Python package, notes, and scripts on mathematical statistics, statistical
methods, and probability


Motivation
----------

Previously, this repository contained notes and some R code to learn
probability and statistics. However, taking notes is a relatively passive
activity. Meanwhile, creating something is a lot more engaging and functional.
So I've decided to reborn this repository into one that reimplements
statistical and probability functions commonly found in R.


Installation / Usage
--------------------

To install use pip:

    $ pip install miscstats


Or clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/erictleung/miscstats.git
    $ python setup.py install
