## Motivation

Previously, this repository contained notes and some R code to learn probability and statistics. However, taking notes is a relatively passive activity. Meanwhile, creating something is a lot more engaging and functional. So I've decided to reborn this repository into one that reimplements statistical and probability functions commonly found in R.
