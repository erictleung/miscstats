# Sample Spaces and the Algebra of Sets

## Vocabulary

- **experiment** - any procedure that can be
    1. repeated infinitely, and
    2. has well-defined possibilities
- **sample outcome** - any of the potential outcomes of the experiment
- **sample space** - all possible outcomes from the experiment
- **event** - a collection of sample outcomes

## Example

### Flipping two coins

Say there's an **experiment** of flipping two fair coins. The experiment of
flipping coins can be repeated infinitely (you just keep on flipping the pair of
coins...) and has well defined possibilities (the coin can either land heads or
tails).

The **sample space** would be `S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}` where `H` represents heads
and `T` represents tails.

A **sample outcome** could be `HH` or heads and then another heads.

The **event** that there are at least one heads would be the following sample
outcomes: `{HH, HT, TH}`.

### Dice roll
